# ExpandedOcean
A mod that adds some more fish to the game, ranging from your typical aquarium fish to fish that shouldn't even be possible to catch! Currently, this mod only has one fish.

## Notes
Fish that will definitely be added in a later update are, currently:
- Chimaera
- Sea Slug
- Gourami
- Sea Butterfly
  
And there are many more to come!
