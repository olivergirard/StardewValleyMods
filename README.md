# StardewValleyMods
My collection of Stardew Valley mods! I like to create mods that change game behavior as well as texture packs that alter the look of the game. Please reach out if you encounter any bugs.

## Installation
Find the mod you would like to use, download the folder it comes in, and place it in your Stardew Valley/Mods folder. If any other mods are needed for my mod to run, that information will be included in my mod's README.md file. My mods all currently work without the Content Patcher mod.

## Mods
### AutoQuarry
A mod that automatically collects resources from the quarry and places them in the player's inventory every morning. Currently, this mod only collects stones from rocks and boulders, ore, and gems. **This mod has not been updated for the 1.6 update, and may not function as intended.**

### EnhancedWheelSpinGame
A mod that makes the wheel-spinning game at the Stardew Valley Fair a little more interesting with added colors and higher stakes. This mod adds two new colors to the wheel and splits the wheel into eight different sections. **This mod has not been updated for the 1.6 update, and may not function as intended.**

### ExpandedOcean
A mod that adds some more fish to the game, ranging from your typical aquarium fish to fish that shouldn't even be possible to catch! Currently, this mod only has one fish.

### LinusEucalyptus
A mod that changes Linus's name to "Eucalyptus". This is based on an inside joke between me and a friend! This mod is simple and will probably never be updated. **This mod has not been updated for the 1.6 update, and may not function as intended.**

### MapForEveryone
A mod that adds the real-time location of all bachelors and bachelorettes to the game's map menu. This should make it easier to find and romance dateable characters.

### TackyTextures
A mod that adds new textures to the assets of the game. It does not modify gameplay mechanics and exists purely to change the game's design. **This mod has not been updated for the 1.6 update, and may not function as intended.**
