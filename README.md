# StardewValleyMods
My collection of Stardew Valley mods! I like to create mods that change game behavior as well as texture packs that alter the look of the game. Please reach out if you encounter any bugs.

## Installation
Find the mod you would like to use, download the folder it comes in, and place it in your Stardew Valley\Mods folder. If any other mods are needed for my mod to run, that will be included in my mod's README.md file.

## Mods
### AutoQuarryMod
A mod that automatically collects resources from the quarry and places them in the player's inventory every morning. Currently, this mod only collects stones from rocks and boulders, ore, and gems. I am working on adding features that will allow for wood and other resources to be collected from fully-grown trees in the quarry. Currently, this mod works all the time, but I would like for it to only work after the quarry has been unlocked.

### LinusEucalyptus
A mod that changes Linus's name to "Eucalyptus". Based on an inside joke between me and a friend! This mod is simple and will probably never be updated.

### EnhancedWheelSpinGame
A mod that makes the wheel spinning game at the Stardew Valley Fair a little more interesting with added colors and higher stakes. This mod adds two new colors to the wheel and splits the wheel into eight different sections.

### TackyTextures
A mod that adds new textures to the assets of the game. This is a visual mod that can be used without the Content Patcher mod. It does not modify gameplay mechanics and exists purely to change the design of the game.
