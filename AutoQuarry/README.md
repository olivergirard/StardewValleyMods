# AutoQuarry
A mod that automatically collects resources from the quarry and places them in the player's inventory every morning. Currently, this mod only collects stones from rocks and boulders, ore, and gems.

## Notes
Currently, this mod works all the time, but I would like for it to only work after the quarry has been unlocked. This mod also needs to be updated to comply with recent Stardew Valley code changes.
