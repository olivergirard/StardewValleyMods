# AutoQuarry
A mod that automatically collects resources from the quarry and places them in the player's inventory every morning. Currently, this mod only collects stones from rocks and boulders, ore, and gems. I am working on adding features that will allow for wood and other resources to be collected from fully-grown trees in the quarry. Currently, this mod works all the time, but I would like for it to only work after the quarry has been unlocked.
